TOP: Google Homepage Mini Assignmenmt

A simple recreation of the google homepage using HTML and CSS. 

At the beginning of the project I had very little idea how to create 
a webpage from scratch. I would like to do this assignment again just to further
cement the concepts I learned into my head. 

I have a much better idea of the differnce between grid and flex, justify and
align properties, and a little bit better of an idea of creating a responsive page. 

There is still loads more to learn and improve on.
